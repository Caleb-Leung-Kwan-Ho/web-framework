# This is my first ever fully CS project, there will be mistakes . Sorry for all the inconvenience to the future engineers who is reading this.

In this Django project, I created several applications. Each application is responsible for its models/DB. I have also built a template for the title bar. Hence, adding data content to the website will be more dynamic and easy to maintain in the long run. 
Things I could have done better:
Setup in a venv
Install the package with requirements.txt 

I could not figure out why my gitignore file won't hide my file. I did try to download the BFG and git-filter-branch. However, I encounter several issues which I don't know how to solve. My OS system is Windows10. As always, using Windows10 to develope sometimes can a pain in the butt. 
Issues that I face with BFG
I installed Java. And I enter "java -jar bfg.jar" into the cmd within the same repo where I downloaded bfg.jar. However, bfg.jar did not loadup. 
Issues that I face with git-filter-branch
I used pip install for installing the file. I followed the steps from "https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository". However, the file still exits in my repo.
